The IoT-based Grey Water System is a revolutionary innovation that harnesses the power of technology to promote water conservation and sustainability. By leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology, this system optimizes the collection, treatment, and reuse of grey water, reducing the demand on potable water sources and minimizing wastewater generation. With real-time monitoring and automated control, the system ensures efficient use of this valuable resource, leading to significant water savings and cost reductions. Moreover, it raises awareness about the importance of water conservation, encouraging individuals to adopt sustainable practices. By embracing this cutting-edge technology, we can create a more water-resilient future, mitigating the impacts of water scarcity and protecting our planet's precious resources for generations to come.
	Design and develop an intelligent grey water management system that collects, treats, and reuses grey water from various sources (kitchen, bathroom, etc.)
	Implement an IoT-based monitoring and control system that enables real-time tracking and management of water usage, flow rate, pH level, and filtered water percentage.
	Promote water conservation by reducing the amount of potable water used for non-potable purposes.
	Provide a cost-effective, sustainable, and scalable solution for residential, commercial, and industrial
