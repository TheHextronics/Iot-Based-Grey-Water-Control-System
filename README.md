The IoT-based Grey Water Control System is an innovative solution for efficient water management in residential, commercial, and industrial settings. This system utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor and control grey water generation, treatment, and reuse. The system consists of sensors, IoT devices, grey water treatment units, and a cloud-based server, enabling real-time monitoring and automation. The system's automated control capabilities optimize grey water treatment based on sensor data and user inputs, ensuring efficient water management. The system also provides a user-friendly interface for remote monitoring and control, enabling users to track and manage water usage effectively. The IoT-based Grey Water Control System promotes water conservation, reduces water bills, and contributes to sustainable water management practices.
