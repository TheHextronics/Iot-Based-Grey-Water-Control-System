1.1	MOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVE

The IoT-based Grey Water System is a revolutionary innovation that harnesses the power of technology to promote water conservation and sustainability. By leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology, this system optimizes the collection, treatment, and reuse of grey water, reducing the demand on potable water sources and minimizing wastewater generation. With real-time monitoring and automated control, the system ensures efficient use of this valuable resource, leading to significant water savings and cost reductions. Moreover, it raises awareness about the importance of water conservation, encouraging individuals to adopt sustainable practices. By embracing this cutting-edge technology, we can create a more water-resilient future, mitigating the impacts of water scarcity and protecting our planet's precious resources for generations to come.

1.2. OUTLINE OF THE PROJECT
    Our project, the IoT-based Grey Water Control System, aims to promote water conservation and sustainability by reusing daily wastewater from sources like kitchen sinks and washing machines. The system monitors and controls the treatment and reuse of grey water, ensuring efficient and safe water management.
The system design includes hardware components such as sensors, IoT devices, and grey water treatment units, as well as software components for data analytics, automation, and control. The system architecture enables real-time monitoring and control, automated treatment and reuse, and remote monitoring capabilities.
The system allows for the reuse of water from various sources, including kitchen sinks and washing machines, and monitors water quality parameters such as pH, flow, and turbidity. The system provides benefits such as water conservation, reduced water bills, increased public awareness, and improved water quality.
The implementation plan includes installation, testing, deployment, and maintenance, as well as user training and support. The project aims to contribute to sustainable water management and promote a more efficient use of water resources.
